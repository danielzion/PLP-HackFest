# AgriWeather

![Live-Demo](https://WeatherAsYouGo.danielzion.repl.co)

AgriWeather is a Team project. This App was intended to be a single-page app, which makes use of Open Weather API. This API contains the weather information of different locations and weather forecasts such as temperature, humidity, wind speed etc.
Â 

## Description

- This webapp was built to to provide both realtime and forecast weather informations for farmers to help plan their adequately. Farmers all over the world can view the weather informations by inputting their farm locations. With its responsive design, users can access the webapp via their laptops, desktops, mobile devices, etc without any display issues.

- **Technology Used**: This webapp makes use of Python Flask. Flask is a light-weight Python web framework, this greatly influenced our decision in choosing it. Since we agreed that the app will be utilising a microservice architecture. This makes it possible for us to only included relevant functionalities tha we need. It is reassuringly secure and exceedingly scalable.

- Another Google Cloud resource called Dialogflow ES API is used, . Dialogflow is being chosen for this purpose as it has most of the machine learning algorithm inbuilt. We simply have to train the WeatherBot to respond to intents.
Â 

## Tech Stack
- The project has been divided into four parts namely: Frontend; Backend; Chatbot and Google Cloud Hosting. A Chatbot named "WeatherBot" will be integrated to the Web App/
Â 

**Client:** Javascript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and jQuery.

Â 

**Server:** Python language, Flask framework, Dialogflow Es and Google Cloud Run.

Â 

Â 

## Features

Â 

`Weather Location Search` Enables users to search for weather info based on location.

Â 

`Weather Forecast` Enables users to get weather info for a given number of days.

Â 

`WeatherBot` A Web App Chatbot which helps users navigate easily and also get weather info instead of using the web page.



## How to Run Locally

Â Â In your Command line interface:

Â Â 

Â Â 1. Clone the repository to your local machine :

Â Â ```bash

Â Â Â Â git clone 

Â Â ```

Â Â 

Â Â 2. Enter into the directory : Â Â Â Â 

Â Â 

Â Â 3. Fetch for remote updates : Â Â Â Â Â 
Â Â 

Â Â 4. Install a vrtual environment package : Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 


Â Â 5. Create a virtual environment : 

Â Â 

Â Â 6. Activate the virtual environment : Â Â 

Â Â 

Â Â 7. Install dependencies : Â 
    pip install requirements.txt

Â Â 8. Start Local Server: 
    python app.py

## How to Contribute

Â Â 1. Create a new branch to make your changes: `git checkout -b <your-branch-name>` Â and make the required changes.

Â Â 

Â Â 2. Stage the file: Â `git add <your-changed-file>`

Â Â 

Â Â 3. Commit your file: `git commit -m "<your-message>"`

Â Â 

Â Â Â Â Â Also, make sure your commit message is detailed with what you changed and where you changed it.

Â Â 

Â Â 4. Push your local changes: Â `git push origin <your-branch-name>` 

Â Â 

Â Â Â Â Â If an error occurs here, it means that someone has made changes to the original file while you were working.

Â Â Â Â 

Â Â Â Â Â Simply run : `git pull origin main` Â to sync your local file with the current main file and run `git push origin <your-branch-name>` again.

Â Â Â Â 

Â Â 5. Visit the remote url on Github to create a pull request.

Â Â
